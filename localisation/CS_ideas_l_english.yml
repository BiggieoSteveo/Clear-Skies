 GER_Stasi_Securocracy:0 "Stasi Securocracy"
 GER_Stasi_Securocracy_desc:0 "The State Security Ministry has become powerful and elite, puppeteering the government from the shadows. With Stasi and the Government now one being, the general population has become obedient and ideologically submissive to propaganda. During the Neu Volkshammer Massacre on the 5th October 2008, the Stasi sieged and opened fire on the legislative building when the CDU attempted to forcefully push reforms through legislature, after a referendum was accused to be invalid by both sides. After most of the dissenting politicans of the country were killed in the Neu Volkshammer, the Stasi, Military and loyal civilan bureaucrats agreed to establish a new junta administration, which previously led the entirety of inhabitable Germany. When the civil war started, the Stasi government remained in control of the north."

 GER_Frontline_Commissars_desc:0 "In the old Soviet system, commissars were simply regional commanders who handled administration and recruitment into the army. However, now we have created a new way of handling commissars. Stasi agents have been integrated into the frontline, allowing for the creation of a structure in the chaos of war, and bolstering soldiers’ morale. Empowering their men with speeches and words, they lead the assault and make sure nobody stays behind."

 WGR_Anarchist_Brigades_desc:0 "The less powerful wing of the CDU is made up of anarchist militias. Forming brigades of armed workers, they are much less organised than the conventional divisions used by the main wing of the party. Despite being less organised, the brigades are effective by utilising guerrilla warfare to disrupt the enemy, as well as human wave tactics to overwhelm them. They are valued members of the CDU’s military, and have helped with major operations using their strategies."

 SOV_Pax_Sovietica_I_desc:0 "With the Soviet Union now being the only superpower, the world has entered a new era of “peace”. The Union has inherited the Roman and British hegemonial periods of peace, and is now the global policeman. With no rival to combat its efforts across the world, the USSR has decreased the budget on defence. Greater funds have been allocated to civilian sectors, due to the fact that this new-found peace has given time to focus on development and technological furtherment."

 SOV_High_Suicide_Rates_I_desc:0 "The Soviet Union has elevated itself to the sole superpower of the world, with its influence extending far and wide with no enemy to rival it. It is seen as the most developed country remaining. Yet, despite all of this, conditions in Russia are miserable and dreary. Risks of famines, extreme cold, and bad weather have turned half of the country and alot of what little arable terrain we had into a near wasteland. The people are depressed, and are unable to truly believe in the apparent “victory” they have achieved, due to the destruction of major cities and the oncoming nuclear winter."
