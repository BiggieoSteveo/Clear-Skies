###Things to keep in mind when using GDP modifiers: 
#Do not use negative operation symbols (Minus symbol) on modifiers that increase growth/spending. 

#GDP Increase - Increases monthly income & growth rate.

	precision = 2
	category = country
}

#GDP Decrease - Decreases monthly income & growth rate.
gdp_decrease = {
	color_type = bad
	value_type = percentage
	precision = 2
	category = country
}

#GDP Spending Increase - Increases the monthly expenses.
gdp_spending = {
	color_type = neutral
	value_type = percentage
	precision = 2
	category = country
}

#GDP Austerity - Decreases the monthly expenses, is very OP meaning it should be acompanied by massive debuffs whenever used in content.

	precision = 2
	category = country
}

#GDP Add To Eco - Adds to total GDP, not growth rate. 1 = 1 bn dollars.

	color_type = bad
	value_type = number
	precision = 2
	category = country
}

#GDP Paying Loan - Increases debt-to-income ratio at which you pay off debt. Much like austerity, representing a high dti ratio in game should mean huge debuffs though.
gdp_paying_loan = {
	color_type = neutral
	value_type = percentage
	precision = 2
	category = country
}

#GDP Defaulting - Decreases debt-to-income ratio and increases monthly debt growth.
